    We are about to celebrate our 75th Independence Day !
    <BR>
    Indepedence and freedom is essential for us to live in a harmonious way. Great people have layed their life for this independence in our country. A person who doesn't know us layed down his life for the whole nation. </FONT> <FONT COLOR = WHITE>  We must be proud to have had such people in our country. We need to think about such people, praise them and thank them whole heartedly. We also need to thank mother India for giving birth to such people. Hence It is mandatory for every Indian to celebrate India's Independence day by hosting the national flag and singing the national anthem (Jana Gana Mana) and the national song (Vande maataram). Let us celebrate the upcoming 75th independence day like never before !

    Jai Hind !

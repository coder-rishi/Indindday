	<p style = "background-color : coral;"> <b> <i> <font size = "4"> <font color = "white"> Abul Kalam Ghulam Muhiyuddin Ahmed bin Khairuddin Al-Hussaini Azad [11 November 1888 – 22 February 1958] was an Indian independence activist, Islamic theologian, writer and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress. <img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Abul_Kalam_Azad_1.jpg/220px-Abul_Kalam_Azad_1.jpg' align = "left"> Following India's independence, he became the First Minister of Education in the Indian government. He is commonly remembered as Maulana Azad; the word Maulana is an honorific meaning 'Our Master' and he had adopted Azad as his pen name.
	His contribution to establishing the education foundation in India is recognised by celebrating his birthday as National Education Day across India. <br>
	As a young man, Azad composed poetry in Urdu, as well as treatises on religion and philosophy. He rose to prominence through his work as a journalist, publishing works critical of the British Raj and espousing the causes of Indian nationalism. Azad became the leader of the Khilafat Movement, during which he came into close contact with the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi. Azad became an enthusiastic supporter of Gandhi's ideas of non-violent civil disobedience, and worked to organise the non-co-operation movement in protest of the 1919 Rowlatt Acts. Azad committed himself to Gandhi's ideals, including promoting Swadeshi (indigenous) products and the cause of Swaraj (Self-rule) for India.
	In 1923, at an age of 35, he became the youngest person to serve as the President of the Indian National Congress. </p>

	<b> <u> <font size = "5"> <font color = "DarkGoldenRod"> Bhagat Singh </b> </font> </u> </font>
	<br>
	<p style = "background-color : DarkGoldenRod;"> <b> <i> <font size = "4"> <font color = "white"> In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, <img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Bhagat_Singh_1929.jpg/220px-Bhagat_Singh_1929.jpg' align = "right"> John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.
	They believed Scott was responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai. Due to this crime he was hanged & killed by the British.
	Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him: "Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name." In still later years, Singh, an atheist and socialist in life, won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists.
	Although many of Singh's associates, as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in daring acts and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and literature to the same extent as Singh. </p>

	<b> <u> <font size = "5"> <font color = "ForestGreen"> Bal Gangadhar Tilak </b> </font> </u> </font>
	<br>
	<p style = "background-color : ForestGreen;"> <b> <i> <font size = "4"> <font color = "white"> Bal Gangadhar Tilak (23 July 1856 – 1 August 1920), born as Keshav Gangadhar Tilak, was an Indian nationalist, teacher, and an independence activist. <img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Bal_Gangadhar_Tilak_crop.jpg/220px-Bal_Gangadhar_Tilak_crop.jpg' align = "Left"> He was one third of the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate. Tilak was the first leader of the Indian independence movement.
	The British colonial authorities called him "The father of the Indian unrest." He was also conferred with the title of "Lokmanya", which means "accepted by the people (as their leader)". Mahatma Gandhi called him "The Maker of Modern India".	
	Keshav Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in an Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family in Ratnagiri, the headquarters of the Ratnagiri district of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay Presidency).
	<br>
	<br>
	His ancestral village was Chikhali. His father, Gangadhar Tilak was a school teacher and a Sanskrit scholar who died when Tilak was sixteen. In 1871, Tilak was married to Tapibai (Née Bal) when he was sixteen, a few months before his father's death. After marriage, her name was changed to Satyabhamabai. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in first class in Mathematics from Deccan College of Pune in 1877. He left his M.A. course of study midway to join the L.L.B course instead, and in 1879 he obtained his L.L.B degree from Government Law College.
	After graduating, Tilak started teaching mathematics at a private school in Pune. Later, due to ideological differences with the colleagues in the new school, he withdrew and became a journalist. Tilak actively participated in public affairs. He stated: "Religion and practical life are not different. The real spirit is to make the country your family instead of working only for your own. The step beyond is to serve humanity and the next step is to serve God." </p>

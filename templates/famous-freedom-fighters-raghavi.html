    <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
    <img align="right"; src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthevideoink.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F12%2FMahatma-Gandhi-quotes-main-1280x720-1.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" length="450" width="400"></img>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi () October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India. He set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and above all for achieving swaraj or self-rule.</p>
    <p>Mahatma Gandhi is truly one of the greatest souls to have walked on the luscious soil of India. He was strong in his belief of non-violence, and it was this very non-violence that victored against the brute strength of the British, and drove them out of our nation's soil.</p>

    <h1>Subhas Chandra Bose</h1>
    <img align="right"; src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fedtimes.in%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fnetaji.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" length="450" width="400"></img>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was another prominent freedom fighter of India. Born in 1897, he tried to gain independence from India with the help of other countries. He worked with Jawaharlal Nehru and, like innumerable freedom fighters, was thrown into prison more than once. However, without giving up, he constantly worked for India's independence. He was also the leader of the Indian Army.</p>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose's role in the freedom of India started when he was 24. When he was interviewing Mahatma Gandhi, he was so moved by the latter's ideals that he joined Mahatma Gandhi in the stuggle against the British rule.</p>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle against the British. Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The fresh interpretation of the India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him.</p>

    <h1>Rani Lakshmi Bai</h1>
    <img align="right"; src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefamouspeople.com%2Fprofiles%2Fimages%2Fog-rani-lakshmibai-5512.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" length="450" width="400"></img>
    <p>Also known as Rani of Jhansi, Rani Lakshmi Bai was born in November 1828, in the town of Varanasi. She was initially named Manikarnika.</p>
    <p>Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May 1842[4][18] and was afterwards called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honour of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and according to the Maharashtrian tradition of women being given a new name after marriage. In September 1851, she gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth. The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died.</p>
    <p>After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was an adopted son, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she was informed of this she cried out <i>"Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi!"</i> (I shall not surrender my Jhansi). In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.</p>
    <p>Until this point, Lakshmibai was reluctant to rebel against the British. In June 1857, rebels of the 12th Bengal Native Infantry seized the Star Fort of Jhansi containing the treasure and magazine,[26] and after persuading the British to lay down their arms by promising them no harm, broke their word and massacred 40 to 60 European officers of the garrison along with their wives and children. The Rani's involvement in this massacre is still a subject of debate.[27][28] An army doctor, Thomas Lowe, wrote after the rebellion characterising her as the "Jezebel of India ... the young rani upon whose head rested the blood of the slain".[29]</p>
    <p>However, nothing ended there. The main battle that took place was the siege of Jhansi, in which Rani Lakshmi Bai died in battle, true to her nation.</p>
